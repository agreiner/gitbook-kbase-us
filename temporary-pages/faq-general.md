# FAQ: General

### How do I set or reset my password?

If you signed up for KBase and yet your password does not seem to work, you may [reset your password](https://kbase.us/reset-password/) at any time. All you will need is access to the email account you originally signed up with. The password reset function is available from this various mentions on this site \(e.g. search for “reset”\), or from the Narrative Interface login form.

### What should I do if my Narrative freezes or won’t load properly?

* See our list of [recommended browsers](https://kbase.us/supported-browsers/) to ensure yours is supported by KBase.
* Try a hard reload \(shift-reload in your browser window\).
* If you’ve used earlier versions of KBase, they may be lurking in your cache and messing things up. Try either clearing your cache or [launching KBase](https://narrative.kbase.us/) from an “incognito” or “anonymous” window \(which doesn’t use your cache\).
* Shut down and restart your Narrative by selecting this option from the top left menu of the Narrative Interface.
