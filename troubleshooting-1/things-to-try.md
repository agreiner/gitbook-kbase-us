# Things to Try

### What should I do if my Narrative freezes or won’t load properly?

* See our list of [recommended browsers](https://kbase.us/supported-browsers/) to ensure yours is supported by KBase.
* Try a hard reload \(shift-reload in your browser window\).
* If you’ve used earlier versions of KBase, they may be lurking in your cache and messing things up. Try either clearing your cache or [launching KBase](https://narrative.kbase.us/) from an “incognito” or “anonymous” window \(which doesn’t use your cache\).
* Shut down and restart your Narrative by selecting this option from the top left menu of the Narrative Interface.
